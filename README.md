# Hey, I'm Aryan 👋

I'm a full-stack engineer focused on building **scalable, real-time systems** with deep integration of backend intelligence, modern frontend UX, and production-grade DevOps. 

I specialize in designing and engineering platforms that go beyond CRUD — systems that react, adapt, and scale.

---

## 🚀 What I Build

- 🛒 **Real-Time  Platforms**  
  Featuring personalized engines with real-time stock updates, flash sale alerts, interactive search caching (Redis), WebSocket user grouping, Stripe integration, and scalable product delivery logic via BullMQ queues.

- 🧠 **Custom Infrastructure & Microservices**  
  Architected with multi-server Docker networks, Kafka message pipelines, healthchecks, service isolation, and scalable async queues. Built to handle high-traffic, low-latency conditions with predictable recovery and memory-safe operations.

- 🌐 **Frontend Systems with Reactive UX**  
  Next.js + React apps with smooth interactions using GSAP/Framer Motion, connected to real-time data sources and optimized for SEO + performance.

## 🧰 My Stack

**Backend & Systems:**  
`Node.js` · `Express.js` · `Redis` (Caching, Pub/Sub, BullMQ, Redis OM) · `PostgreSQL` · `MongoDB` · `Prisma` · `Mongoose` · `GraphQL` · `Kafka` · `WebSockets` · `Socket.IO` · `Microservices`

**Frontend:**  
`Next.js (App Router)` · `React.js` · `Tailwind CSS` · `Framer Motion` · `GSAP` · `Pixi.js` · `Three.js`

**DevOps & Infra:**  
`Docker` · `Vercel` · `Render` · `Railway` · `GitHub Actions` · `Nginx` · `Healthchecks` · `Multi-container Services` · `Scalable Event-Driven Architectures`

## 🧩 Systems I Solve

- Multi-room WebSocket subscriptions (product updates, group flash deals)
- Smart search caching with user interactivity scoring (Redis)
- BullMQ-based cleanup + retry queues
- Distributed cart stock validation before Stripe checkout
- Auto-unsubscribe socket logic with idle timers
- Search scaling via microservice and inter-service message pipelines
- Incremental cache pruning based on popularity thresholds
- Real-time UI sync with backend services
